# customSongs
This is my first attemp in modding so it may be a bit bugged. Others can not hear what you are listening, only you. I dont think I can come with a solution to that due to lack of time.

WebFishing mod that allows custom songs on the boombox

**A FOLDER CALLED "songs" NEEDS TO BE CREATED IN THE SAME FOLDER WHERE webfishing.exe IS LOCATED**

Simply add any .ogg file into that folder called "songs"
